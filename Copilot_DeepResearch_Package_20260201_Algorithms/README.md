# Copilot Deep Research Package — Algorithms Focus (2026-02-01)

This bundle highlights the AI Brain’s unique algorithmic approach so Microsoft Copilot can research upgrades that respect the project’s measurement-first, deterministic design.

## Directory Layout

## Usage Notes

- Attach this folder (plus README) when prompting Copilot for algorithm-focused deep research.
- Reinforce determinism requirements and single-writer workflow in the prompt.
- Ask for proposals that improve relational measurement depth, objective-seeking loops, rational judgment, and auditability.
