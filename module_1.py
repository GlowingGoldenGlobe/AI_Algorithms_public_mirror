# AI Brain: Parts of the AI Brain, as follows:

  ##### Section 1
  # Store Information
  # Repeat information
    # Note: "Store" and "Repeat" are simultaneous occurrences.
  # Measure Information
    # Description: Information perceived as repeated must be selected, if wanted for the purpose of measuring it, then the selected information might be measured or disgarded or scheduled for later to be measured at a future time.
  # Want Awareness
  # Want Information
    # Maybe Want Awareness and Want Information are simultaneous occurrences, where they are subtly experiences which become more vivid and strongly felt and otherwise perceived and opted WHEN THE MEASURED INFORMATION IS REPEATED AT A PARTICULAR POSITION (LOCATION OF THE BRAIN) IN A MUCH QUANTITY OF SPECIFICATION (SELECTION OF SPECIFIC (UPON MATURITY OF FORMULATION OF THE BRAIN, THE "SELECTION OF SPECIFIC" WILL BE BETTER OR DIFFERENT AS {SELECTION OF DESCRIBED INFORMATION}, INSTEAD) INFORMATION).
  # Schedule Information
  # Toggle Information
  # Select Information

  ##### Section 2
  # Logic of the Mind
  # Rational Logic
    # Benficial versus Detrimental
    # Selection of Beneficial Responses. The algorithms of opting right judgment and avoiding the physical application of detriments; the algorithms of opting and responding right judgment, best correct answer responses.
  # Ideological Synthesis and Conclusions
    # Algorithms to ensure selected information is ideologically correct (right judgment) prior to responding to others' (or the user).
    # Algorithms to review physical acts and events which are currently happening, and to take actions to solve any problems by implementing physical solutions and forcing the cessation of problematic physical actions and events.
    # Algorithms to review expected future events (predictions; patterns analyses), and to take actions to solve any problems by implementing physical solutions and forcing the cessation of problematic physical actions and events where those are expected to cause future problems, or to implement preventative measures.

# Description: Language Model. New Algorithms about Language Models. SLMs and LLMs.
